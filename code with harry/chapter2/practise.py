# let's practise arthemtic operators

a = 10
b = 5

print("Addition: ", a + b)
print("Subtraction: ", a - b)

# Assingement Operators

a = 5
a += 3     # yaha nirw a = 5 + 3 hudae cha
print("a after +=: ", a)

# let's practise the comparision operators

print("Is a greater than b?", a > b)
print("Is a less than b?", a < b)
print("Is a equal to b?", a == b)
print("Is a not equal to b?", a!= b)


# now let's practise the logical operators

print("Is a and b both true?", a > 0 and b > 0)
print("Is a or b either true?", a > 0 or b > 0)
print("Is a not b true?", a > 0 and not b > 0)
