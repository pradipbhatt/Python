# user le input garnu cha vane use the input() function and store that  into some variable practise again 

# let's make the calculator

secondnum = input ("Enter a second number: ")

# sum = firstnum + secondnum; yesto gare concatenate garxa 

sum = int(firstnum) + int(secondnum)  # int() function is used to convert the string into integer
