# There may be times when we want to specify a variable, this may be done with typecasting. BEing python oop launguage and such as it uses classes to define the data types including its primitive types

# typecasting garda we need constructor functions

# Typecasting of the integers

x=int(1)
y=int(2.3333)
z=int("34")

print(x,y,z)
print(type(x),type(y),type(z))  #here the types of each variables have integer types

# Typecasting of the floats
x=float(33)
y=float("2.5")
z=float(True)

print(x,y,z)
print(type(x),type(y),type(z))  # here the types of each variables have float types

# Same way we may type cast to string by using x = str("hello lilly")
