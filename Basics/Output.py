# Python - Output Variables

# hamilae tha vayeko print() function also used to output variables

x = "Too good that's why she left"
print(x)

# now add the many variables and values

x = "Python"
y= "JS"
z = 11.11

print(x,y,z) #here we print the many varaibles at once

# we can also use the format() function to print variables

x = "Python"
y= "JS"
z = 11.11

print(f"I love {x} and {y}, the average of {z} is {z/2}") #here we print the many varaibles at once using format() function
# Tya agadi use vayeko f stants for format function

# Lets use the + operator to assign the multiple variables

x = "Python"
y= "JS"
z = "dear lily"

print(x+y+z) # but here is hack we cant concatenate srings with the numbers and floats we just concatenate strings with strings 
# because + operator only works for strings
